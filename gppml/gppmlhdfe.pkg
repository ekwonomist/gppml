d PPML with High Dimensional Fixed Effects (authors: Sergio Correia, Paulo Guimarães, Thomas Zylkin)
d
d This package implements Poisson Pseudo-Maximum Likelihood (PPML) estimation with
d high-dimensional fixed effects (HDFE) using the Iteratively Re-weighted Least Squares (IRLS)
d algorithm. It is heavily reliant on the reghdfe and ftools packages.
