d Generalized-PPML with High Dimensional Fixed Effects (authors: Ohyun Kwon, Jangsu Yoon, Yoto V. Yotov)
d
d This package implements the test of Constant Variance-to-Mean Ratio (cvmrtest) and 
d Generalized-Poisson Pseudo-Maximum Likelihood (GPPML) estimation with
d high-dimensional fixed effects (HDFE) using the Iteratively Re-weighted Least Squares (IRLS)
d algorithm. It is heavily reliant on the hdfe packages.
